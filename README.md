[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with some modifications.

## Scripts

All scripts should be executed in the root directory.

To be able to run anything locally you have to run `yarn install` first.

Use `yarn start` to run the app in development mode.  
This will automatically reload the page if you make edits.  

To build the application you can run `yarn build`.  
It will make the app production ready in the `build` folder.
